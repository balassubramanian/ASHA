# Aasha
A Disaster Management System

Aasha is an application designed to assist people in the event of a flood. During the timeline of the Hackathon we aim to build an iOS app and website(administrator) for Aasha.

**Aasha has three main features:**

### Help 

Help feature is a Chatbot which is the first responder which helps victims with the basic instructions to get to safety. 
* The User can use the 'SOS' feature and the app will send the GPS coordinates to the nearest shelter and officials can
         rescue them immediately.
* 'SafePoint' feature navigates the user to the nearest shelter.
* General Queries

If the user doesn't have access to the internet, the bot will also be available on demand SMS.

    
### Map 

Map displays the map of the affected areas and the user can contribute to report incidents and damaged pathways by making annotations on the map. This will make the rescue process much safer and easier.


### Nearby

Sometimes rescue or help from the authorities can be delayed due to the unvavailability of manpower. So using the Nearby feature the user can help or ask for help from people nearby. It can be for rescue, food, drinking water, shelter etc.

### Technologies That We Plan On Using

* XCode (IDE)
* MySql (Backend)
* Microsoft Bot Framework (ChatBot)
* Twillo (SMS Bot)
* Apple MapKit (Map)
* Nearby Feature (Using spatial queries)
* Azure (Cloud)
